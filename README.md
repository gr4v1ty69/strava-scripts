# Strava Custom Scripts

Two userscripts that enhance your Strava experience: one unlocks premium route planning features for free, and the other adds beautiful custom map layers to your activity pages.

## 🚴 Scripts Overview

### Strava Route Planner for All
Unlock Strava's premium route planning features without a subscription. Create and edit routes with all the tools normally reserved for paid members.

### Strava Custom Maps
Transform your activity maps with 9 different map styles including topographic, cycling-focused, winter, satellite, and hiking trail overlays. Perfect for analyzing your routes with specialized maps.

## 📥 Installation

1. **Install a userscript manager** (one-time setup):
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) - Works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
   - [ViolentMonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/)
   - [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)

2. **Install the scripts** once the usescript manager is installed:
   - Click here for : [strava-custom-maps](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/gr4v1ty69/strava-scripts@main/strava-custom-maps.user.js)
   - Click here for : [strava-route-planner](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/gr4v1ty69/strava-scripts@main/strava-route-planner-for-all.user.js)
